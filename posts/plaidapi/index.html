Introduction
Over Christmas break, I found myself thrown into the festivities, enjoying time spent with family, looking forward to the new year and preparing for it, that I missed my credit card payment for the month.  Now you all may say, &ldquo;oh that no big deal&rdquo;. It is. I was using this card a lot through the month, so when the statement generated by my bank is sent to the credit brearu, it reduces my credit score. Now that I am not happy about.">

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Over Christmas break, I found myself thrown into the festivities, enjoying time spent with family, looking forward to the new year and preparing for it, that I missed my credit card payment for the month.  Now you all may say, &ldquo;oh that no big deal&rdquo;. It is. I was using this card a lot through the month, so when the statement generated by my bank is sent to the credit brearu, it reduces my credit score. Now that I am not happy about.</p>
<p>Life can get hectic, and I was trying to figure out how best to work with actully maintaining and improving my credit score.</p>
<h2 id="project-overview">Project overview</h2>
<p>This project fetches finiacl dat from my bank  (CIBC), perocesses credit card balances, limit and other dat. Then schedules reminders for upcoming payment due dates. The goal is to ensure I never miss a payment and maintain a clear overview of my credit usage.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>
<p>Retrieve Financial Data
The script connects to Plaid API to pull in bank account and credit card details.
It extracts key information: available balance, total credit limit, and current spending.</p>
<p>Calculate Credit Usage
The system determines how much credit is used vs. the total limit.
It flags high usage to encourage better financial decisions.</p>
<p>Schedule Payment Reminders
The script integrates with Google Calendar API to create reminders for credit card due dates.
It ensures that each account&rsquo;s due date is tracked and notifies the user in advance.</p>
<h2 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</h2>
<p>Enhancing security measures with encrypted storage.</p>
<h2 id="implementing-security-into-the-plaid-api-project">Implementing security into the Plaid API Project:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Secure Authentication with OAuth 2.0
Plaid provides an OAuth authentication flow, but if using API keys, store them securely using environment variables or a secret manager.
Rotate API keys periodically and apply the principle of least privilege.</li>
<li>Data Encryption &amp; Storage Security
Ensure sensitive financial data (like account balances and transactions) is encrypted at rest using AES-256.
Use TLS 1.2+ for securing API requests in transit.
Avoid logging sensitive user data in plaintext.</li>
<li>API Security &amp; Rate Limiting
Implement API request validation using HMAC signatures to prevent unauthorized modifications.
Use Plaid’s IP whitelisting to restrict access from untrusted sources.
Apply rate limiting (e.g., 100 requests per minute) to prevent abuse.</li>
<li>Secure Webhooks &amp; Callback URLs
Verify webhook signatures to ensure the data comes from Plaid.
Avoid exposing sensitive information in webhook responses.
Restrict callback URLs to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Monitoring &amp; Logging for Threat Detection
Log all authentication attempts and API errors for auditability.
Use SIEM solutions (e.g., Splunk, ELK) to monitor for anomalies.
Set up alerts for unauthorized access attempts or failed API calls.</li>
<li>Compliance &amp; Privacy Considerations
Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance by allowing users to delete their financial data upon request.
Implement data masking for non-admin users viewing transaction history.</li>
