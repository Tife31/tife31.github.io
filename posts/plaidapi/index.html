<p>My credit card was in pain after christmas, and I was not paying attention. I was too invloved with the festivities, spending time with family and friends.</p>
<p>Come January, the aftermath comes crashing through the door. Now is the time to stick to the resolutions made, you look at the reciepts and take a look at your bank statement. And there was a charge from my bank that I there had been no trade for. I had missed my credit card payment deadline and my credit score would be affected. Way to start the new year right?</p>
<p>I decdied to write a program that gets my credit card details using Plaid API, processes it and checks when would be the best time to pay my bill  before the deadline, as well as help boost my credit card score.</p>
<h2 id="project-overview">Project overview</h2>
<p>This project fetches financial data from my bank, processes credit card balances, limits and other data to attain a calculated amount to balance the difference.  Using this amount, a reminder is sent to my calender with a due date to ensure I keep up with my payments.</p>
<p>The goal is to ensure I never miss a payment and maintain a clear overview of my credit usage.</p>
<p>This projects focus would be both on how it workds and  the security of using this API and why it is inportant.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>
<h3 id="retrieve-financial-data">Retrieve Financial Data</h3>
<p>My project connects to Plaid API to pull in bank account and credit card details.
It extracts key information: available balance, total credit limit, and current spending.</p>
<h3 id="calculate-credit-usage">Calculate Credit Usage</h3>
<p>In my project, the data is processed to determine how much credit is used vs. the total limit.</p>
<h3 id="schedule-payment-reminders">Schedule Payment Reminders:</h3>
<p>My project then integrates with Google Calendar API to create reminders for my credit card due date.
It ensures that all credit cards in  my account, has its due date as well as amount owed calculated and tracked.  This information is sent to my calender in advance.</p>
<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>This project works well the sandbox environment. Gaining actuall access to my account would have been jumping through some hoops major authentication. I could not justify that over simply setting reminders by myself on my phone. The security from the Plaid company is strong, which is what we want!</p>
<h2 id="from-a-security-perspective">From a security perspective.</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Both APIs integrated into my project (Plaid API and Google calender API )handle sensitive user data. These APIs implement strict security controls to prevent unauthorized access. Both APIs use:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secure Authentication with OAuth 2.0 and encryption
OAuth 2.0 ensures you never receive user credentials (e.g., bank passwords). Instead, you get tokens that grant permission-based access. Plaid Api requires you to get a temporary public token that will be exchanged for a permanent token to use to retrieve your bank data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit permissions → Request only necessary API scopes to reduce attack surface.
When you create a link_token (which initializes Plaid Link), you specify only the necessary products (e.g., transactions, auth, identity, etc.). This ensures my app does not gain excessive access.
and follows the Least Privilege Principle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use Plaid’s Webhooks Securely
Plaid suggests using webhooks to be notified when transactions are ready instead of polling repeatedly. Webhooks provide event-driven notifications, reducing the need for polling (which could expose API keys more often).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</h2>
<p>The next step is to initiate a balance transfer if sufficent funds are in my debit card, send a notification then that this amount had been paid instead of creating a to do in my calender.</p>
<p>Enhancing security measures with encrypted storage.</p>
