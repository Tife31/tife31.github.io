      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My credit card was in pain after christmas, and I was not paying attention. I was too invloved with the festivities, spending time with family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Come January, the aftermath comes crashing through the door. Now is the time to stick to the resolutions made, you look at the reciepts and take a look at your bank statement. And there was a charge from my bank that I there had been no trade for. I had missed my credit card payment deadline and my credit score would be affected. Way to start the new year right?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
